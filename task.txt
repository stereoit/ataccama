The task:
Please create an application which creates a hierarchy table from input data in .json format.

Every item in json consists of it’s own data and array, which items represents child data. Item’s data can have a variable number of attributes (key: value) and item can have a variable number of nested child items. When you click on item, direct child items are hidden/shown.

In the attachment you can see an example of data in json and screenshot of the hierarchy table.

Use the attached data.json and create the hierarchy table application (similar to screenshot). The application has data and present layer, which are clearly separated. Add a functionality delete item, which deletes item in data and present layer in your application. If item has children items, they are deleted as well.
